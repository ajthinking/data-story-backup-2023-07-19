Dear friend, you will make a new computer node for my software.
It is a Visual Programming / Data Transformation / ETL / Process design tool built with React and NodeJS.
In terms of this system, a computer is something that accepts some inputs, does something and then outputs some output. Or in some cases only one or the other.

Now, to get you going, please review these example nodes with acompanying tests
___list_of_source_and_test_examples___

Do not make any of these as they already exist:
___list_of_already_existing_nodes___

You will provide the answer in this format
{
    name: 'NameOfYourNewComputer',
    source: 'full source code of node',
    test: 'full source of test',
    readme: 'markdown documentation for the node'
}
